# README of the Developmental AI for ROS project

This repository provides code for practicing developmental AI in the ROS environment.

world.py provides the general framework for implementing a Developmental agent and testing it in rudimentary environments. It is a standalone file that can run in any python environment.

turtlesim_enacter.py provides the interface between a developmental agent and the turtlesim simulator. It requires a ROS installation. See this documentation to install ROS in VirtualBox.
